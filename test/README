By default, this package is configured to run Nose tests
(https://w.amazon.com/index.php/Nose).

Prefix the test files with 'test_'.

Run the tests by calling:
$ brazil-build test

To run a single/few test files, just provide a path to the files:
$ brazil-build test test/test_foo.py test/test_bar.py

To report the code coverage:
$ brazil-build test --with-coverage --cover-package=[YOUR_PYTHON_PKG]
The --cover-package parameter should have your Python package name (not the
brazil package) as this will limit the coverage reports to your code only.

To debug the failing tests:
$ brazil-build test --pdb
will drop you into the Python debugger on the failed test.
